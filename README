UploadWizard is an extension for MediaWiki, which adds a more user-friendly wizard for uploading media files.

Although developed with Wikimedia Commons in mind, it should be useful for other users of MediaWiki as well.
However it has not been tested extensively with non-Wikimedia installations of MediaWiki. Your feedback will
help greatly.

UploadWizard is licensed under the same terms as MediaWiki itself.

If you are using UploadWizard in an environment where licenses are not used, you may want to add the
configuration below in LocalSettings.php. This will limit the license choices to a single default that
references the wiki's generic disclaimer. Note that there are many other configuration settings to add
depending on your use case.

$wgUploadWizardConfig = [
	'licensing' => [
		'ownWorkDefault' => 'own',
		'ownWork' => [
			'type' => 'or',
			'template' => 'licensing', // this adds a link to Template:Licensing to the file info page
			'licenses' => [
				'generic',
			],
		],
	],
];

If you wish to modify the generic messages, you can modify them within the wiki at the following pages:
* MediaWiki:mediauploader-source-ownwork
* MediaWiki:mediauploader-source-ownwork-assert-generic
* MediaWiki:mediauploader-source-ownwork-generic-explain
